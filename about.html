        <h2 >Why did i start this Project?</h2>
            <p>The idea to create this website came when i was finding things to work upon my skills of Web Development during this lockdown. Thats when i decided to pursue a course of Web Development from FreeCodeCamp. There in the last assignment,I was told to built a Restaurant web application.So I thought of building Ankan's Secret Corner.It is a completely responsive website that consists of different food items including menu and chef's recommendations.
            <b>And for that i came up with this Website</b></p>
